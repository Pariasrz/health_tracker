            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This web-based application is built as a project for Bachelor Degree by Paria Sarzaeim, a computer science student at Alzahra University, supervised by Dr. N. Kia. </p>
            <p>Nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques play important roles in our daily life as well as in the world of the computer science. Bearing this point in mind, the goal of this project was to compare different machine learning algorithms and investigate the most suitable one to check the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. </p>
            <p>Due to our research, Artificial Neural Network algorithm shows a better performance in compare to other machine learning algorithms including Na√Øve Bayes, K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Therefore, we used Artificla Neural Network on this website. </p>
            <p>Neural networks are processing systems similar to human neural networks which are consisted of neurons and links. Multilayer neural networks use a post-propagation algorithm to change the weights in the links of the network. Then, it can calculate the error of each neuron due to these weights. The output of the algorithms will be the label of the input data.</p>
            <P>Using your data, the algorithm mentioned earlier on this website will tell you the probability of a cardiovascular disease's presence or absence.</P>
